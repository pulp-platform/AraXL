The scaled up Ara version AraXL is a vector unit working as a coprocessor for the CVA6 core.
It supports the RISC-V Vector Extension, [version 1.0](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-v-spec/releases/tag/v1.0).

AraXL architecture consists of multiple Ara instances (Ara2 - https://github.com/pulp-platform/ara) and each Ara2 cluster is a lane based vector processor. 
Multiple Ara2 clusters are interconnected with interfaces designed to access the L2 memory, other neighboring clusters and receive vector instructions from the CVA6 scalar core.

AraXL is developed as part of the [PULP (Parallel Ultra-Low Power) Platform](https://pulp-platform.org/), a joint effort between ETH Zurich and the University of Bologna.

## Dependencies

Check `DEPENDENCIES.md` for a list of hardware and software dependencies of Ara.

## Supported instructions

Check `FUNCTIONALITIES.md` to check which instructions are currently support by Ara.

## Get started

Make sure you clone this repository recursively to get all the necessary submodules:

```bash
make git-submodules
```

If the repository path of any submodule changes, run the following command to change your submodule's pointer to the remote repository:

```bash
git submodule sync --recursive
```

## Toolchain

Ara requires a RISC-V LLVM toolchain capable of understanding the vector extension, version 1.0.

To build this toolchain, run the following command in the project's root directory.

```bash
# Build the LLVM toolchain
make toolchain-llvm
```

Ara also requires an updated Spike ISA simulator, with support for the vector extension.

To build Spike, run the following command in the project's root directory.

```bash
# Build Spike
make riscv-isa-sim
```

## Verilator

Ara requires an updated version of Verilator, for RTL simulations.

To build it, run the following command in the project's root directory.

```bash
# Build Verilator
make verilator
```

## Configuration

Ara's parameters are centralized in the `config` folder, which provides several configurations to the vector machine.
Please check `config/README.md` for more details. This sets the number of lanes and the `VLEN` per Ara cluster.

By default the number of clusters is 2 and the number of lanes per clusters is 4 for an 8 lane AraXL configuration.

To change the configuration set `nr_clusters=4` and `nr_lanes=8` when compiling applications or hardware.

Prepend `config=chosen_ara_configuration` to your Makefile commands, or export the `ARA_CONFIGURATION` variable, to chose a configuration other than the `default` one.

## Software

### Build Applications

The `apps` folder contains example applications that work on Ara. Run the following command to build an application. E.g., `hello_world`:

```bash
cd apps
make bin/hello_world
```
fmatmul example for 32 lane configuration
```
make bin/fmatmul nr_clusters=4 nr_lanes=8
```

### SPIKE Simulation

All the applications can be simulated with SPIKE. Run the following command to build and run an application. E.g., `hello_world`:

```bash
cd apps
make bin/hello_world.spike
make spike-run-hello_world
```

### RISC-V Tests
To run the standardized [https://github.com/riscv-software-src/riscv-tests](https://github.com/riscv-software-src/riscv-tests) for AraXL, run
```bash
make riscv_tests
```
This downloads the latest repository containing standardized riscv tests and build all the unit tests and the benchmarks.

A patch is applied to update the `tohost` memory location to the memory mapped `EOC` register in AraXL used by the verilog test bench to return a pass/success status.

The test binary can be run as usual from the `hardware/` folder
```bash
make sim preload=<path-to-the-risc-test-binary>
```

## RTL Simulation

### Hardware dependencies

The Ara repository depends on external IPs and uses Bender to handle the IP dependencies.
To install Bender and initialize all the hardware IPs, run the following commands:

```bash
# Go to the hardware folder
cd hardware
# Install Bender and checkout all the IPs
make checkout
```

### Patches (only once!)

Note: this step is required only once, and needs to be repeated ONLY if the IP hardware dependencies are deleted and checked out again.

Some of the IPs need to be patched to work with Verilator.

```bash
# Go to the hardware folder
cd hardware
# Apply the patches (only need to run this once)
make apply-patches
```

### Simulation

To simulate the Ara system with ModelSim, go to the `hardware` folder, which contains all the SystemVerilog files. Use the following command to run your simulation:

```bash
# Go to the hardware folder
cd hardware
# Only compile the hardware without running the simulation.
make compile nr_clusters=4 nr_lanes=8
# Run the simulation with the *hello_world* binary loaded
app=hello_world make sim
# Run the simulation with the *some_binary* binary. This allows specifying the full path to the binary
preload=/some_path/some_binary make sim
# Run the simulation without starting the gui
app=hello_world make simc
```

We also provide the `simv` makefile target to run simulations with the Verilator model.

```bash
# Go to the hardware folder
cd hardware
# Apply the patches (only need to run this once)
make apply-patches
# Only compile the hardware without running the simulation.
make verilate
# Run the simulation with the *hello_world* binary loaded
app=hello_world make simv
```

It is also possible to simulate the unit tests compiled in the `apps` folder. Given the number of unit tests, we use Verilator. Use the following command to install Verilator, verilate the design, and run the simulation:

```bash
# Go to the hardware folder
cd hardware
# Apply the patches (only need to run this once)
make apply-patches
# Verilate the design
make verilate
# Run the tests
make riscv_tests_simv
```

Alternatively, you can also use the `riscv_tests` target at Ara's top-level Makefile to both compile the RISC-V tests and run their simulation.

### Traces

Add `trace=1` to the `verilate`, `simv`, and `riscv_tests_simv` commands to generate waveform traces in the `fst` format.
You can use `gtkwave` to open such waveforms.

### Ideal Dispatcher mode

CVA6 can be replaced by an ideal FIFO that dispatches the vector instructions to Ara with the maximum issue-rate possible.
In this mode, only Ara and its memory system affect performance.
This mode has some limitations:
 - The dispatcher is a simple FIFO. Ara and the dispatcher cannot have complex interactions.
 - Therefore, the vector program should be fire-and-forget. There cannot be runtime dependencies from the vector to the scalar code.
 - Not all the vector instructions are supported, e.g., the ones that use the `rs2` register.

To compile a program and generate its vector trace:

```bash
cd apps
make bin/${program}.ideal nr_clusters=4 nr_lanes=8
```

This command will generate the `ideal` binary to be loaded in the L2 memory for the simulation (data accessed by the vector code).
To run the system in Ideal Dispatcher mode:

```bash
cd hardware
make sim app=${program} ideal_dispatcher=1 nr_clusters=4 nr_lanes=8
```

### VCD Dumping

It's possible to dump VCD files for accurate activity-based power analyses. To do so, use the `vcd_dump=1` option to compile the program and to run the simulation:

```bash
make -C apps bin/${program} vcd_dump=1
make -C hardware simc app=${program} vcd_dump=1
```

Currently, the following kernels support automatic VCD dumping: `fmatmul`, `fconv3d`, `fft`, `dwt`, `exp`, `cos`, `log`, `dropout`, `jacobi2d`.

### Linting Flow

We also provide Synopsys Spyglass linting scripts in the hardware/spyglass. Run make lint in the hardware folder, with a specific MemPool configuration, to run the tests associated with the lint_rtl target.
